# AutoBlur_AI

Auto Blur AI is a lightweight web application that automatically detects and blurs sensitive information in uploaded images and documents.
The system combines Tesseract OCR with spaCy NLP to intelligently identify data such as transaction IDs, phone numbers, emails, monetary values, and order numbers. Detected regions are blurred using OpenCV, ensuring privacy before sharing.

The application supports two modes:

Default Mode → Automatically blurs all sensitive details and provides a secure downloadable version.

Custom Mode → Lets users interactively toggle blur on detected regions for fine-grained control.

Built with Flask (Python) on the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript on the frontend, the project demonstrates how AI and computer vision can be applied to practical privacy-preserving use cases such as invoices, receipts, IDs, and financial documents.
